/**
 * The ImageSplicingDetection class is an application that detects splicing in an image.
 * It reads an image file, performs splicing detection, and outputs the result.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - Requires Java AWT and ImageIO libraries.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Specify the path to the image file in the 'imagePath' variable.
 * - The 'detectSplicing' method contains the splicing detection algorithm, which can be implemented based on specific requirements.
 * - The main method reads the image file, calls the 'detectSplicing' method, and displays the result.
 *
 * Note: This example includes a placeholder implementation for splicing detection that assumes all images are spliced.
